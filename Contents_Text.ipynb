I am sure he will agree that, with the ongoing expansion of the illegal settlements, the demolition of the Bedouin village of Khan al-Ahmar, the national state law enacted by the Knesset and the US Administration's decisions to cease funding, relocate its embassy to Jerusalem and close the PLO office in Washington, it is all going in the one direction. The Tánaiste mentioned that he met President Abbas during the week and conveyed to him his willingness to recognise the state of Palestine, which is welcome. This is the position of Fianna Fáil also.

I do not want to overstate how influential Ireland might be. We are a relatively small player but we speak to all of the key partners. We have a good relationship with the Palestinian leadership and, I think, a reasonably good relationship with the Israeli Government. I have made it my business to get to know some of the key decision-makers on the US side as well. We are trying to move matters in the right direction. My stated position in regard to the kind of outcome that I believe is necessary is pretty clear. I do not believe there will be a deal done on a peace process in the Middle East without the US being central to it but I believe that other countries need to be involved to reassure the Palestinians that they have friends around the table given the deterioration of the relationship between the Palestinian Authority and the US over the past 12 months in particular.\n",

I am as passionate as anyone in this House about the need to create pressure and a political environment that can help to encourage a peace process to develop. However, I am not in the business of supporting legislation that I know is unimplementable and not legally sound and will create a legal problem with the European Commission, as both the Deputy and I are aware.\n",

      "The national plan on business and human rights which was launched by me last November sets out a number of key commitments to ensure policy coherence across government. The first is to commission a study to conduct a comprehensive baseline assessment of the legislative and regulatory framework pertaining to business and human rights as it currently applies in Ireland. Work on the study is under way and expected to be completed by the end of October. We have also been pressing ahead with plans to establish a business and human rights implementation group which will oversee delivery of the plan. I suspect the frustration of the Deputy centres on the group not yet being up and running, a frustration, to be honest, I share. I had a chairperson in mind for the particular job who I believed would be really good, but for a series of reasons, that person cannot now do it. We have had to look elsewhere for the appropriate team of people to be able to do this work properly and give the leadership needed to the implementation group. We are now making progress in that regard. Given its pivotal role, it is critical that the composition of the group have the appropriate mix of experience. Some unavoidable delays have been experienced in securing the availability of suitably qualified persons to serve on it. Nevertheless, I expect to be in a position to make an announcement in the near future. \n",

The actions to be undertaken include building awareness among State-owned and other companies and NGOs of the need to exercise effective due diligence on human rights issues, particularly where there is a risk of adverse human rights impacts. Particular attention has been given to ensuring coherence with the second national plan on corporate social responsibility which is overseen by my colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys. State-owned and controlled companies were included in the public consultation process leading up to the national plan which encouraged awareness of effective human rights due diligence.\n",

I does not reflect well on the Government's commitment to its own national plan. It was rightly criticised for delays in creating the plan. There is serious concern about the lack of human rights due diligence by State-owned or controlled companies. I presume that is the reason for establishment of the group. Is the Minister aware that the ESB is importing millions of tonnes of coal from Colombia, specifically from the infamous Cerrejón mine? Has he been made aware that the coal is coming from mines which are notorious for destroying the environment, displacing communities and attacking local community activists? The Government is the main shareholder in the ESB. Has the Minister's Department had discussions with the ESB on the human rights due diligence that should follow, detailing the notorious abuses in the Colombian mines from where it sources coal? That is just one example. I tried to table a Topical Issue on the matter, but the Minister was not available to discuss it.

However, it cannot happen overnight without a significant disruption to power supplies. It needs to be planned for and phased in over time.

If the committee was established, it would inform the ESB's decisions. I am disappointed that the Minister is not aware of what I raised. I am still awaiting a response from the ESB on its awareness of it, as well as from the Department of the Communications, Climate Action and Environment.

All of that work is important and continuing. However, when one is focused on trying to get a deal done, one needs to start talking about solutions, rather than dealing with problems, while at the same time ensuring we are planning for all scenarios, as we are. While I understand Deputy Lisa Chambers's focus on contingency planning and while we will give her as much information as we can, between now and the middle of November I want the focus to be on getting a deal done. When people talk about a chasm between the UK and EU positions, I do not accept that. What we have is a withdrawal treaty that has been 90% written and agreed to. The last 10% is difficult to agree. Most of it relates to Ireland and the Irish backstop. However, the commitment from the UK Prime Minister is a backstop that will provide the guarantees necessary that there will be no physical border infrastructure on the island of Ireland in the future. To her credit, she has committed to this. What we now need is a legal text that deliver will it in the Irish protocol that will be part of the withdrawal treaty. This can be done in an intensification of the negotiations in the next two weeks.\n",

The first step is to get the deal done. What is likely to happen - starting, I suspect, from today - is that the negotiating teams will lock themselves into a very intense period of negotiation, focusing on the unresolved issues, one of which is the Irish backstop. That is what is needed. I hope we will have a recommendation for the October leaders' Council meeting resulting from that intensification of negotiations. I am not aware that the UK side has yet tabled any formal new proposal, but the UK Prime Minister has certainly committed to doing so. I hope that in the next week or so we will see that new proposal being brought forward because I am sure the EU task force will also have ideas and, of course, concerns about some of what may be proposed. Everybody understands a deal needs to be done in the next few weeks. With flexibility and good will on both sides, that deal can be done. Certainly on the EU side, Mr. Michel Barnier will work to protect EU interests and the integrity of the Single Market and the customs union, but he will sensibly also try to find a way forward by showing flexibility in appropriate areas.\n",

The Irish Government must make it clear that the Good Friday Agreement will be protected and will remain the basis for peace, stability and progress. It was endorsed by the majority of people in the North and the South. It is a people's agreement, and is not a chip to be bargained with by the Tories or the DUP.\n",

      "I made it clear during the week that, while I have respect for Arlene Foster, she is wrong on this issue. The Good Friday Agreement is not up for discussion or negotiation. It is a treaty which has been lodged with the UN. It was voted on by people across this island, North and South, and was endorsed with a very large majority in both jurisdictions. It has been the basis for peace for the past two decades. There have been updates to it, and agreements have been signed since it was agreed, but those agreements involved two Governments and negotiations between political parties. We have a clear commitment from the British Prime Minister that every facet of the Good Friday Agreement will be protected through the Brexit process, and we intend to ensure that commitment is followed through on. To the credit of the Prime Minister, she has repeated that commitment on more than one occasion.\n",

As such, the Good Friday Agreement must be protected in all its parts. We need to maintain the free movement of people on the island of Ireland between Britain and Ireland. There must be a complete absence of a land border on the island of Ireland, and the rights of EU and non-EU nationals must be protected, in line with EU rules and regulations. There must be continued access to EU funds and payments for the North of Ireland and greater autonomy for the devolved assembly in these policy areas, which are not excluded matters and are within the competence. These things must be protected via the backstop agreement, and I ask the Tánaiste to reiterate that that is the direction the Government is taking during these talks.\n",

I have repeatedly said that the British Prime Minister, to her credit, understands the fragility and complexity of relationships on the island of Ireland and wants to protect those through Brexit. I believe that all parties in Northern Ireland, including the DUP, recognise that too. We are trying to ensure that a legal text emerges here in a way that reassures nationalists and unionists in Northern Ireland and on the island of Ireland that we can provide the guarantees necessary to reassure people that no physical border infrastructure is going to re-emerge on the island of Ireland and that we are not going to create new barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom either, recognising the sovereign integrity of the United Kingdom as a whole. We need maturity and flexibility to ensure that, through an intensification of negotiation, we can get that job done. I believe it is possible to do it. The alternatives to doing so remind people of the consequences of failure, which in my view are unlikely to materialise.\n",

I and my officials are, of course, in very regular contact with Michel Barnier and his team. I also have regular meetings and conversations with British Ministers which offer the opportunity to discuss the negotiations. I have taken every opportunity to impress upon UK counterparts the importance of the backstop. In my recent meetings or conversations with Dominic Raab, Jeremy Hunt, David Lidington and Karen Bradley I emphasised that it was the responsibility of the UK to put forward viable and workable proposals for the backstop, and I encouraged the UK to engage constructively on the issue, including on Michel Barnier’s efforts to de-dramatise the backstop, which I believe were very sincere and have made the problem much more manageable.

Our preference is for an overall EU-UK relationship which would resolve all issues. However, it remains essential for a legally operable backstop, which provides certainty that a hard border will be avoided in any circumstances, to be agreed. Therefore, it cannot be temporary. It must be in place unless and until another solution is found. This position is supported and shared by our fellow EU member states.

It is the job of the British side to make a proposal. I hope it will not publish any proposal before it has been brought to the negotiating room in Brussels. The British and EU sides need to work together in that room to find a position that both of them can support. We are at the business end of these negotiations now. In my view, the negotiations need to make progress in the next two weeks - we are talking about next week or next weekend - before the General Affairs Council meeting, which I will attend, and the leaders' summit, which will be attended by the Taoiseach. Time is short. The focus now has to be on trying to close gaps between the two negotiating teams. If a British paper is part of that effort, it will be welcome. The most important thing is for the detail of that to be worked through by the negotiating teams, as opposed to it being published and essentially assessed by the wider community.

I have made it my business to get to know some of the key decision-makers on the US side as well. We are trying to move matters in the right direction. My stated position in regard to the kind of outcome that I believe is necessary is pretty clear. I do not believe there will be a deal done on a peace process in the Middle East without the US being central to it but I believe that other countries need to be involved to reassure the Palestinians that they have friends around the table given the deterioration of the relationship between the Palestinian Authority and the US over the past 12 months in particular.\n",

The first is to commission a study to conduct a comprehensive baseline assessment of the legislative and regulatory framework pertaining to business and human rights as it currently applies in Ireland. Work on the study is under way and expected to be completed by the end of October. We have also been pressing ahead with plans to establish a business and human rights implementation group which will oversee delivery of the plan. I suspect the frustration of the Deputy centres on the group not yet being up and running, a frustration, to be honest, I share. I had a chairperson in mind for the particular job who I believed would be really good, but for a series of reasons, that person cannot now do it. We have had to look elsewhere for the appropriate team of people to be able to do this work properly and give the leadership needed to the implementation group. We are now making progress in that regard. Given its pivotal role, it is critical that the composition of the group have the appropriate mix of experience. Some unavoidable delays have been experienced in securing the availability of suitably qualified persons to serve on it. Nevertheless, I expect to be in a position to make an announcement in the near future. \n",

The actions to be undertaken include building awareness among State-owned and other companies and NGOs of the need to exercise effective due diligence on human rights issues, particularly where there is a risk of adverse human rights impacts. Particular attention has been given to ensuring coherence with the second national plan on corporate social responsibility which is overseen by my colleague the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Heather Humphreys. State-owned and controlled companies were included in the public consultation process leading up to the national plan which encouraged awareness of effective human rights due diligence.\n",

I does not reflect well on the Government's commitment to its own national plan. It was rightly criticised for delays in creating the plan. There is serious concern about the lack of human rights due diligence by State-owned or controlled companies. I presume that is the reason for establishment of the group. Is the Minister aware that the ESB is importing millions of tonnes of coal from Colombia, specifically from the infamous Cerrejón mine? Has he been made aware that the coal is coming from mines which are notorious for destroying the environment, displacing communities and attacking local community activists? The Government is the main shareholder in the ESB. Has the Minister's Department had discussions with the ESB on the human rights due diligence that should follow, detailing the notorious abuses in the Colombian mines from where it sources coal? That is just one example. I tried to table a Topical Issue on the matter, but the Minister was not available to discuss it.

However, the Government has committed to ending the use of coal as a source of power generation by the mid-2020s. I am happy to say we will see a move away from a reliance on imported coal. However, it cannot happen overnight without a significant disruption to power supplies. It needs to be planned for and phased in over time.

If the committee was established, it would inform the ESB's decisions. I am disappointed that the Minister is not aware of what I raised. I am still awaiting a response from the ESB on its awareness of it, as well as from the Department of the Communications, Climate Action and Environment. Clearly, Ireland is part of the problem through its importation of coal from the mine. It is not someone else's problem but ours. Will the Minister commit to raising the issue with the ESB?\n",

The purpose in having an implementation group is to try to set guidelines and ensure they will be implemented and followed in order that companies, whether they are State or private, in their sourcing policies will be conscious of some of their broader corporate responsibilities in the sourcing lines they support. The Government is interested in moving away from a coal-based power generation system at Moneypoint. That is a strategic policy decision it has made, but its management and implementation are complicated. However, the ESB has the obligation to follow through on it.\n",

All of that work is important and continuing. However, when one is focused on trying to get a deal done, one needs to start talking about solutions, rather than dealing with problems, while at the same time ensuring we are planning for all scenarios, as we are. While I understand Deputy Lisa Chambers's focus on contingency planning and while we will give her as much information as we can, between now and the middle of November I want the focus to be on getting a deal done. When people talk about a chasm between the UK and EU positions, I do not accept that. What we have is a withdrawal treaty that has been 90% written and agreed to. The last 10% is difficult to agree. Most of it relates to Ireland and the Irish backstop. However, the commitment from the UK Prime Minister is a backstop that will provide the guarantees necessary that there will be no physical border infrastructure on the island of Ireland in the future. To her credit, she has committed to this. What we now need is a legal text that deliver will it in the Irish protocol that will be part of the withdrawal treaty. This can be done in an intensification of the negotiations in the next two weeks.\n",

The first step is to get the deal done. What is likely to happen - starting, I suspect, from today - is that the negotiating teams will lock themselves into a very intense period of negotiation, focusing on the unresolved issues, one of which is the Irish backstop. That is what is needed. I hope we will have a recommendation for the October leaders' Council meeting resulting from that intensification of negotiations. I am not aware that the UK side has yet tabled any formal new proposal, but the UK Prime Minister has certainly committed to doing so. I hope that in the next week or so we will see that new proposal being brought forward because I am sure the EU task force will also have ideas and, of course, concerns about some of what may be proposed. Everybody understands a deal needs to be done in the next few weeks. With flexibility and good will on both sides, that deal can be done. Certainly on the EU side, Mr. Michel Barnier will work to protect EU interests and the integrity of the Single Market and the customs union, but he will sensibly also try to find a way forward by showing flexibility in appropriate areas.\n",

This has been marked as green, indicating it has been agreed at negotiator level, and it is a welcome provision in seeking to maintain the CTA, insofar as it relates to the EU-UK negotiations.\n",

It is rarely mentioned that the Good Friday Agreement is a rights-based document and, as such the rights enshrined in it must be protected. The recent comments by the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, and people within the Tory Party on the Good Friday Agreement are unacceptable and reveal a reckless disregard for the peace process, prosperity and progress. The Irish Government must make it clear that the Good Friday Agreement will be protected and will remain the basis for peace, stability and progress. It was endorsed by the majority of people in the North and the South. It is a people's agreement, and is not a chip to be bargained with by the Tories or the DUP.\n",

It is a treaty which has been lodged with the UN. It was voted on by people across this island, North and South, and was endorsed with a very large majority in both jurisdictions. It has been the basis for peace for the past two decades. There have been updates to it, and agreements have been signed since it was agreed, but those agreements involved two Governments and negotiations between political parties. We have a clear commitment from the British Prime Minister that every facet of the Good Friday Agreement will be protected through the Brexit process, and we intend to ensure that commitment is followed through on. To the credit of the Prime Minister, she has repeated that commitment on more than one occasion.\n",

As such, the Good Friday Agreement must be protected in all its parts. We need to maintain the free movement of people on the island of Ireland between Britain and Ireland. There must be a complete absence of a land border on the island of Ireland, and the rights of EU and non-EU nationals must be protected, in line with EU rules and regulations. There must be continued access to EU funds and payments for the North of Ireland and greater autonomy for the devolved assembly in these policy areas, which are not excluded matters and are within the competence. These things must be protected via the backstop agreement, and I ask the Tánaiste to reiterate that that is the direction the Government is taking during these talks.\n",

      "I do not believe that I or the Taoiseach could be clearer on this matter. We cannot and will not sign up to any withdrawal treaty that does not involve a backstop that follows through on the commitments that have been made to Ireland. I have repeatedly said that the British Prime Minister, to her credit, understands the fragility and complexity of relationships on the island of Ireland and wants to protect those through Brexit. I believe that all parties in Northern Ireland, including the DUP, recognise that too. We are trying to ensure that a legal text emerges here in a way that reassures nationalists and unionists in Northern Ireland and on the island of Ireland that we can provide the guarantees necessary to reassure people that no physical border infrastructure is going to re-emerge on the island of Ireland and that we are not going to create new barriers to trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom either, recognising the sovereign integrity of the United Kingdom as a whole. We need maturity and flexibility to ensure that, through an intensification of negotiation, we can get that job done. I believe it is possible to do it. The alternatives to doing so remind people of the consequences of failure, which in my view are unlikely to materialise.\n",

I and my officials are, of course, in very regular contact with Michel Barnier and his team. I also have regular meetings and conversations with British Ministers which offer the opportunity to discuss the negotiations. I have taken every opportunity to impress upon UK counterparts the importance of the backstop. In my recent meetings or conversations with Dominic Raab, Jeremy Hunt, David Lidington and Karen Bradley I emphasised that it was the responsibility of the UK to put forward viable and workable proposals for the backstop, and I encouraged the UK to engage constructively on the issue, including on Michel Barnier’s efforts to de-dramatise the backstop, which I believe were very sincere and have made the problem much more manageable.

Our preference is for an overall EU-UK relationship which would resolve all issues. However, it remains essential for a legally operable backstop, which provides certainty that a hard border will be avoided in any circumstances, to be agreed. Therefore, it cannot be temporary. It must be in place unless and until another solution is found. This position is supported and shared by our fellow EU member states.

It is the job of the British side to make a proposal. I hope it will not publish any proposal before it has been brought to the negotiating room in Brussels. The British and EU sides need to work together in that room to find a position that both of them can support. We are at the business end of these negotiations now. In my view, the negotiations need to make progress in the next two weeks - we are talking about next week or next weekend - before the General Affairs Council meeting, which I will attend, and the leaders' summit, which will be attended by the Taoiseach. Time is short. The focus now has to be on trying to close gaps between the two negotiating teams. If a British paper is part of that effort, it will be welcome. The most important thing is for the detail of that to be worked through by the negotiating teams, as opposed to it being published and essentially assessed by the wider community.

They followed a similar pattern. On the platform was a group of overpaid executives. Off the platform in the audience was a crowd of battered shareholders who had had a difficult time in recent years. In the background was a history of exorbitant standard variable rate mortgages. Both banks have executed a punitive regime on their customers in terms of standard variable rate mortgages.\n",

He bottled it. At the end of both AGMs, we found out that the Minister had unfortunately cast in favour of all board resolutions. In the case of AIB, these included an increase in the remuneration of the chair by 33% on last year, from €275,000 to €365,000. When standard variable rate mortgage holders are suffering so much, this seems inappropriate. It seems even more inappropriate that the Minister should be casting those votes in the board's favour at a time when the shareholders were suffering so much.

At the end of the day, though, they were all getting more than €80,000 per year, the chairman is now getting €365,000 per year, standard variable rate mortgage holders are suffering and the directors are milking the bank.\n",

The conclusion of this analysis indicated no reason to vote against the resolutions that dealt with the report of the directors, the auditors' report, the accounts, the remuneration of the auditors or authorisations relating to the issuance of shares.\n",

      " In Bank of Ireland, total directors' remuneration in 2014 was €2.76 million, down marginally on the 2013 total of €2.77 million. Within this total, it is worth noting the following: total remuneration costs, including pension contributions where applicable, for the two executive directors and the governor and deputy governor remained unchanged year on year. Since May 2009, the group CEO has waived a portion of his salary to the sum of €67,000. In addition, in 2014 he waived €51,000 of his pension accrual for the year, resulting in the pension cost to the bank being the same as the cost in 2013. Against this backdrop, to vote against the proposed resolution on directors' remuneration would have been a significant and serious matter and could be perceived as interfering in a commercial entity that could do damage to Ireland and - the Deputy referred to shareholders, the taxpayers - the value of our bank investments. Accordingly, the Minister decided that it was appropriate to vote in favour of these resolutions.\n",

I am not surprised and do not blame the Minister of State because he is carrying the can for a decision that was made elsewhere. I am not surprised to hear him state aggregate levels have gone down slightly. The fact is that he did not address the issue. How can he support an increase of 33% in the pay of the AIB chair? The profits he quotes are questionable. He knows that because it has a lot to do with what one allows for bad debts and how one provides for them. One can control the banks' profits. They made huge reductions, which are questionable this time, but the chairman got a 33% increase. That is not excusable at this time.\n",

      " Consider the Minister of State's statement that 99% of investors voted in favour of the decision. He is correct in the case of the Bank of Ireland. In the case of AIB, 100% voted in favour of the decision, which was even worse. It is disingenuous for the Minister of State to say here that the shareholders voted in favour of the decision. He, and certainly whoever wrote his script, well know that the big shareholders are the people who voted. A vote by the small shareholders would certainly result in a large majority voting against the pay. The chairman of Bank of Ireland gets a lot more than the chairman of AIB. He gets €490,000 in a remuneration package. He is a man who, with the chairman of AIB, is simply a refugee from British banking. The United Kingdom is where they were found. Neither of them was wanted in the United Kingdom. They land over here and get huge sums of money, €500,000 per year in one case. That is inexcusable. The Minister voted in favour of Mr. Richie Boucher, the chief executive, getting a package of €843,000. Let us justify that.\n",

It is no good for the Minister to come in here and ask us to wait to see what happens next week. He had a great opportunity to say he would not vote favourably unless the bank did something about the unfortunate mortgage holders but he bottled it. He could have done what I describe, sacked the board and put in his own people who would change the policy of the banks.\n",

Sometimes I cannot help but think that, unless he and Deputy Finian McGrath were running the banks, he would not be pleased with the performance of anybody running them. The reality is that the Government has to take a holistic view. Deputy Shane Ross talks about shareholders, the taxpayer and the small person. These are people who want to know that every cent of taxpayers' money pumped into the banking system, or at least into the live banks and not the zombie banks that Fianna Fáil put money into, will be recouped.\n",

We made it very clear in the Spring Economic Statement. The Minister will bring in the all the bank representatives next week and we will work on the issue.

It was founded in 2012 by the housing association Respond! and has provided a safe harbour for some 64 for women and 84 children since then. It is a refuge with a difference in so much as it is a second-stage facility designed to provide temporary accommodation and advice to women referred by emergency refuges or other State agencies. Without such a facility, women and children have no choice but to return to abusive partners or be allocated to accommodation for the homeless.

State agencies, including Tusla, accept that Respond! has identified a definite need to care for women and children who must move on from emergency refuges. The typical stay may be from six to nine months while alternative arrangements are made to procure housing for the women and children concerned. I accept the budgetary situation remains difficult and that, in particular, the Tusla budget is under pressure.

On foot of this, the HSE decided that it was not in a position to add the drug to the list of reimbursable items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes. The manufacturer submitted a new application to the HSE on 25 July 2014 for the inclusion of Fampridine in the community drug schemes.

      " It is very regrettable that I have to raise this issue and I know that the Minister of State agrees with me when I say that. The death of another newborn child in Cavan General Hospital yesterday is a very serious and troubling matter. This is the fourth newborn child to be lost in the maternity unit at the hospital in the past 30 months, within which time we have yet to see findings or recommendations in respect of any of the previous tragic outcomes. That is compounding the serious impact all of these outcomes have on the confidence of a dependent community in Cavan, Monaghan and neighbouring counties. It is absolutely imperative that the Minister and his Department intervene immediately to ensure the reports under preparation following the conclusion of the investigations of those given the responsibility to carry them out are brought forward with all due speed and published. In that way, people will have the opportunity to see the findings and recommendations made and very quickly thereafter the implementation of same. It is very reasonable and understandable that many people in the constituency in which I live and which I am honoured to represent believe because of the absence of findings and recommendations, including in the very first case, that of baby Jamie Flynn in November 2012, that the subsequent tragic outcomes could have been avoided if the full gamut of information had been available and the necessary steps taken. Sadly, there was yet another case yesterday. \n",

In the case of AIB, these included an increase in the remuneration of the chair by 33% on last year, from €275,000 to €365,000.

Since May 2009, the group CEO has waived a portion of his salary to the sum of €67,000. In addition, in 2014 he waived €51,000 of his pension accrual for the year, resulting in the pension cost to the bank being the same as the cost in 2013. Against this backdrop, to vote against the proposed resolution on directors' remuneration would have been a significant and serious matter and could be perceived as interfering in a commercial entity that could do damage to Ireland and - the Deputy referred to shareholders, the taxpayers - the value of our bank investments.

      " Consider the Minister of State's statement that 99% of investors voted in favour of the decision. He is correct in the case of the Bank of Ireland. In the case of AIB, 100% voted in favour of the decision, which was even worse. It is disingenuous for the Minister of State to say here that the shareholders voted in favour of the decision. He, and certainly whoever wrote his script, well know that the big shareholders are the people who voted. A vote by the small shareholders would certainly result in a large majority voting against the pay. The chairman of Bank of Ireland gets a lot more than the chairman of AIB. He gets €490,000 in a remuneration package. He is a man who, with the chairman of AIB, is simply a refugee from British banking. The United Kingdom is where they were found. Neither of them was wanted in the United Kingdom. They land over here and get huge sums of money, €500,000 per year in one case. That is inexcusable. The Minister voted in favour of Mr. Richie Boucher, the chief executive, getting a package of €843,000. Let us justify that.\n",

It was founded in 2012 by the housing association Respond! and has provided a safe harbour for some 64 for women and 84 children since then. It is a refuge with a difference in so much as it is a second-stage facility designed to provide temporary accommodation and advice to women referred by emergency refuges or other State agencies. Without such a facility, women and children have no choice but to return to abusive partners or be allocated to accommodation for the homeless.

Respond! is now confronted by what it says is an unavoidable decision, to close Cuan Álainn. State agencies, including Tusla, accept that Respond! has identified a definite need to care for women and children who must move on from emergency refuges. The typical stay may be from six to nine months while alternative arrangements are made to procure housing for the women and children concerned. I accept the budgetary situation remains difficult and that, in particular, the Tusla budget is under pressure.

On foot of this, the HSE decided that it was not in a position to add the drug to the list of reimbursable items supplied under the GMS and other community drug schemes. The manufacturer submitted a new application to the HSE on 25 July 2014 for the inclusion of Fampridine in the community drug schemes.

I ask the Minister of State to give some indication as to when she believes we will get an answer to this question. I am not looking for a specific date, but it is very important that some indication be given to MS sufferers who see no grounds for hope. They cannot afford this drug which is simply too expensive. To make matters worse, they saw the difference it had made to their lives but then it was taken away from them owing to the expense involved. We cannot continue with a situation where all questions tabled by elected representatives on this issue are answered in the same way. We cannot see the finish line. If we do nothing else today, can we, at least, receive a indication as to whether a decision will be made in six or 12 months? When will the HSE make a decision on whether it will cover the cost of this drug for MS sufferers?\n",

      "My opinion on when we will have an answer is irrelevant. What we need to do is ensure the drug is affordable for the State. It was withdrawn by the drug company involved. Fampridine was never available under the GMS or the drug refund scheme. It was both cruel and unfortunate for people who had obtained huge benefits from it when it was withdrawn. We are still looking at the question of whether it is affordable. That may sound cold and callous, but I do not mean it to come across in that way, as I understand the difference the drug has made to peoples' lives. We are doing our very best to ensure something that will benefit people will be available to them. However, there are cases where drugs are simply unaffordable. I understand this might appear to be a harsh decision, but we have not given up. We are still looking at the issue. I hope whatever decision is made, whether good or bad, will be relayed to patients as quickly as possible because it is equally cruel to leave them hanging on.\n",

The death of another newborn child in Cavan General Hospital yesterday is a very serious and troubling matter. This is the fourth newborn child to be lost in the maternity unit at the hospital in the past 30 months, within which time we have yet to see findings or recommendations in respect of any of the previous tragic outcomes. That is compounding the serious impact all of these outcomes have on the confidence of a dependent community in Cavan, Monaghan and neighbouring counties. It is absolutely imperative that the Minister and his Department intervene immediately to ensure the reports under preparation following the conclusion of the investigations of those given the responsibility to carry them out are brought forward with all due speed and published. In that way, people will have the opportunity to see the findings and recommendations made and very quickly thereafter the implementation of same. It is very reasonable and understandable that many people in the constituency in which I live and which I am honoured to represent believe because of the absence of findings and recommendations, including in the very first case, that of baby Jamie Flynn in November 2012, that the subsequent tragic outcomes could have been avoided if the full gamut of information had been available and the necessary steps taken. Sadly, there was yet another case yesterday. \n",

      "As I said to the Deputy, Aer Lingus is now in a period of offer. This morning, the board of Aer Lingus issued a statement which briefly referenced IAG's intentions regarding the future of the company and indicated Aer Lingus would operate as a separate business with its own brand, management and operations, and would continue to provide connectivity to Ireland while benefiting from the scale of being part of a larger IAG group. The Minister briefed the Cabinet on the up-to-date situation. The Aer Lingus is now in an offer period. The working group appointed by the Minister will engage with IAG in the coming days to consider all of the implications of the offer being made. I must be very careful about what I say. This is the position. Aer Lingus is now in an offer period. The appointed persons arising from the tenders will be announced tomorrow by the Minister. The Government, as the guardian of the public interest, must take into account the wider implications of any such offer, taking into account the issues of conductivity, regionalisation, employment and workers and their rights and the implications contained in the offer from IAG. The working group, together with those who will be appointed tomorrow, will engage with IAG, and the Government will consider this very carefully, very thoroughly and very competitively as is its duty being the guardian of the public interest.\n",

      "Concerns about the potential sell-off of Aer Lingus will not have been assuaged by the Taoiseach's answer. My concern is the Government will follow the example of Fianna Fáil on this issue, as it has on so many other issues. When Fianna Fáil privatised Aer Lingus, Sinn Féin opposed it tooth and nail, and an Teachta Martin was a very prominent member of the Government at the time. The Taoiseach acknowledged that direct air services, air route conductivity and other elements are vital for investment, tourism and business on this island. Tens of thousands of jobs throughout the island rely on global air connections.\n",

      "Let us be very clear. The recommendation from the board that the airline be sold to IAG cannot go ahead without the Government's approval and the Taoiseach should not approve this sell-off. A likely outcome could well be major job losses and the end of important air connections, including the strategically important Heathrow slots. It is also reported, and the Taoiseach might be able to comment on this, that senior executives at Aer Lingus would earn more than €30 million from their bonus share schemes if a sell-off proceeds. If that is true, the Government is facing a choice of either rewarding wealthy businessmen at the expense of Irish citizens or defending Irish national interests.\n",

Our Government must also take into account services and connections via Heathrow, competition in the air transport market, jobs in the Irish aviation sector, the Aer Lingus brand, the question of the impact on the economies of the region and so on but, as I said to the Deputy and to Deputy Martin, the board of Aer Lingus has met and it has issued a statement to the effect that it is willing to consider the offer being made by IAG.

That is the process that is ahead and, as I said, the Government will pay great attention and give comprehensive consideration to all the issues that arise from the offer being made. The Deputy is right in that if a decision were to be made in this regard in any way, it would have to have the approval of Dáil Éireann. These matters will be given very careful consideration both by the Minister in weighing up all the issues involved and taking into account the shareholding responsibility of the Ministry for Finance. The Government will weigh up all those options, taking those issues very seriously into account, particularly connectivity, workers' employment, regional impact and the future for our country in respect of this particular matter.\n",

He also said that a decision on this cannot be passed unless the Dáil supports it, but the Government has a thumping majority in the Dáil and can do whatever it wants in this Chamber. What about the workers? IAG would not be seeking to buy this company unless it was profitable and it is profitable not least because of the efforts of the workforce. The Government needs to be loyal to the workforce. It needs to stand by the workers. There is a clear need at this time of recovery to ensure that it is a balanced recovery, not a two-tier recovery, and that the current employment levels at Aer Lingus are maintained, expanded and built upon. This is hugely important for the local economies of the regions involved. There are 3,900 citizens employed by Aer Lingus and there are huge fears that there would be a negative effect for those in Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports.\n",

The State, through its stake in Aer Lingus, has the potential and the duty to be an advocate for its sustainable development in the interests of its customers, its workers and the island as a whole. IAG does not have those same interests. Like any other private multinational conglomerate, its objective will be to get the maximum profit from its share. I invite the Taoiseach once again to put Irish interests first and commit clearly now to opposing any sell-off of Aer Lingus.
